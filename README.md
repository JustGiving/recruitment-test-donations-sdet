# Recruitment Test - Charity Donations (SDET)

An unattended SDET recruitment test for JustGiving.

## The Challenge
Test an _imperfect_ application that displays the latest donations for a charity using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

### Requirements
A good solution will

* have integration and unit tests
* use _appropriate_ front end tooling

Please put your solution on a repository hosting service such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). (it is always nice to see a clean commit history). Finally, don't forget the README file for your solution.
